        <p>
          Smart glasses integrate advanced technology, including AR displays,
          sensors, and wireless connectivity. However, external environmental
          factors such as weather conditions can significantly impact their
          performance and usability.

        <p>
          Effects of Weather Conditions Battery Performance Cold temperatures
          reduce lithium-ion battery efficiency, leading to shorter battery
          life. Heat can cause overheating issues, reducing overall device
          longevity. Example: Users report faster battery drain in winter
          conditions on devices like Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses. Durability &
          Hardware Limitations High humidity and rain can affect internal
          components, especially in non-water-resistant models. Dust and sand
          may interfere with sensors and cameras, leading to performance
          degradation. Some models integrate water-resistant coatings, but
          extreme weather can still cause failures. Display & Sensor
          Functionality Bright sunlight can impact AR display readability,
          requiring adaptive brightness adjustments. Fogging due to sudden
          temperature changes affects visibility. Some manufacturers apply
          hydrophobic and anti-glare coatings to mitigate these issues.
          Connectivity & Sensor Accuracy GPS and wireless signals may weaken in
          extreme conditions like heavy rain or storms. Motion and biometric
          sensors can experience inaccuracies due to environmental interference.
        </p>
        <p>
          While smart glasses are evolving with improved materials and software
          adaptations, extreme weather conditions continue to challenge their
          performance. Manufacturers are actively developing solutions such as
          better battery management, enhanced water resistance, and adaptive
          display technologies to improve functionality across diverse
          environments.
